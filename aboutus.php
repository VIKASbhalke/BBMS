  'HELPING HANDS' is the first product of the PBL batch 8 team . 'Blood is recognised as the most precious element that sustains life. It saves innumerable lives across the world in a variety of conditions . Once in every 2-seconds, someone, somewhere is desperately in need of blood. More than 29 million units of blood components are transfused every year. The need for blood is great-on any given day, approximately 39,000 units of Red Blood Cells are needed. Each year, we hope to meet up to 1% (approx) of our nation's demand for blood transfusion. <br> Please register yourself as a blood donor now! <br> We would also like to thank our friends , teachers and well-wishers for all your support and encouragement throughout this project. It is now reasonably safe to say that we together have made this society a slightly better and safer place to live in. Lets continue to help each other with our donations. <br> Thank you and Happy Blood Donating! <br> Subhadip Pal <br> Srujan R Bangera <br> Yajnesh R Kunder <br> Vikas <br><img src="Imagesproject/logoone.jpg" width="300px" height="300px" ALIGN="right"/></p>
